## My process

I first began with the HTML skeleton for the project and then proceeded to implement the CSS styles for the final look and outcome.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Using HTML and CSS together with Bootstrap to create a simple yet stylish component.

- Update: Removed Bootstrap and used Flex Box layout which worked better in this case.

### Continued development

To eventually make the QR Component interactive and to produce a Modal Component for a working website.
